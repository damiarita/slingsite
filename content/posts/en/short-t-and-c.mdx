# Slingsite: Terms of Service in Plain English

Welcome to Slingsite! By using Slingsite, you agree to our [official legal terms](/en/terms-and-conditions/).

But hereâ€™s the deal in simple terms:

## Your Files Stay Yours & Private
**Your files never leave your device**. All compression happens locally in your browser. We don't upload or store your files, and you keep 100% of the rights to your content.

## Free to Use
You can use this tool for **personal, commercial, and even automated purposes**. We want you to build faster websites!

## The Rules
Please use our service responsibly. You cannot:
- Process illegal, harmful, or obscene content.
- Use this for any military applications.
- Process content that violates someone else's copyright or intellectual property.
- Try to hack, break, or abuse our site.

## No Promises, Use at Your Own Risk
The service is provided "as-is." We can't guarantee it will always be available or work perfectly. **You use it at your own risk**, and we are not responsible for any damages, data loss, or quality issues that may occur.

## You Are Responsible for Copyright
If you compress files you don't have the rights to, that's on you. We are not responsible for copyright infringement by users.

## Privacy & Data
- We use Google Analytics to track anonymous usage (like what file formats are most popular). We never track file content or names.
- We use Sentry to collect error reports to help us fix bugs.
- If you sign up for our newsletter, we'll never sell your email, and you can unsubscribe at any time.

## Future Changes
Right now, the service is free. In the future, we might add ads, affiliate links, or update/discontinue the service.

## Credits & Open Source
Our site is open source under the MIT license at [https://github.com/damiarita/slingsite]. We gratefully acknowledge the third-party libraries we use to make this work.

By using Slingsite, you agree to these terms. The official legal stuff is below, governed by Spanish law.
