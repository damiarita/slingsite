# We Value Your Privacy

Your images and videos never leave your deviceâ€”all processing happens locally in your browser. We do not see, upload, or store your files.

We collect limited, anonymous usage statistics via Google Analytics 4 (file format, dimensions, size) and error reports via Sentry to improve our service. If you subscribe to our newsletter via MailChimp, we will use your email to send updates and service reminders. You can unsubscribe or request deletion of your data at any time.
