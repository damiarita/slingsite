## Stop Slowing Down Your Website with One-Size-Fits-All Images

Most image compressors have a fatal flaw: they just take your giant image and make it a "slightly smaller" giant image. If you are sending a 1920px wide desktop image to a user on a smartphone, you are wasting bandwidth, hurting your loading speeds, and damaging your Google rankings.

SlingSite is different. We don't just compress; we optimize.

When you upload a file, we instantly generate the 9 essential versions every modern website needs. We create three perfectly scaled sizes (Mobile, Tablet, Desktop) in three next-generation formats (JPG, WebP, AVIF). This ensures every visitor gets the exact file they need—nothing more, nothing less.

<FAQ question="How to Optimize Images for Maximum Page Speed?" h={2}>
Achieving a 100/100 Google PageSpeed score starts with your assets. Here is how our workflow fixes your Core Web Vitals in seconds:

1. Upload: Drop your high-quality master image (JPG or PNG).
1. Smart Analysis: Our engine detects the visual complexity to balance quality vs. file size.
1. Generation: We produce 9 specific assets:
   - Mobile (450px): For smartphones, preventing the "Breakpoint Trap" where phones download tablet-sized images.
   - Tablet (850px): Perfectly sized for iPads and vertical tablets.
   - Desktop (1920px): High-definition for large monitors.
1. Download: You get a tidy .zip file with every asset named and organized, ready for production.

<FAQ question="JPG vs. WebP vs. AVIF: Why You Need All Three?" h={2}>
  Modern web standards require serving next-gen formats to compatible browsers
  while keeping a safety net for older ones. We generate all three
  automatically. - AVIF (The Performance King): Up to 50% smaller than JPG with
  superior quality. This is the format you want 80% of your users to see. - WebP
  (The Modern Standard): Supported by 97% of browsers. Offers ~30% savings over
  JPG and supports transparency. - JPG (The Universal Fallback): Ensures your
  image loads on legacy browsers or older devices.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ question="Why do I need specific Mobile images? Can't I just use the Desktop one?">
  You can, but it kills your performance. If a user is on a phone (screen width
  ~390px) and downloads a Desktop image (1920px), their browser has to download
  25x more pixels than necessary. This spikes your LCP (Largest Contentful
  Paint) metric, which is a major factor in Google's ranking algorithm. Our
  mobile versions are optimized specifically for the 350px–450px traffic spike.

<FAQ question="Why use WebP?">
To serve the best image to every user automatically, use the HTML5 `<picture>` tag. Here is a standard snippet you can copy and paste using the files we generate:

```HTML
<picture>
  <source media="(min-width: 1200px)" srcset="image-desktop.avif" type="image/avif" width="1920" height="1080">
  <source media="(min-width: 1200px)" srcset="image-desktop.webp" type="image/webp" width="1920" height="1080">
  <source media="(min-width: 1200px)" srcset="image-desktop.jpg" type="image/jpg" width="1920" height="1080">

  <source media="(min-width: 768px)" srcset="image-tablet.avif" type="image/avif" width="850" height="480">
  <source media="(min-width: 768px)" srcset="image-tablet.webp" type="image/webp" width="850" height="480">
  <source media="(min-width: 768px)" srcset="image-tablet.jpg" type="image/jpg" width="850" height="480">

  <source media="(max-width: 767px)" srcset="image-mobile.avif" type="image/avif" width="450" height="254">
  <source media="(max-width: 767px)" srcset="image-mobile.webp" type="image/webp" width="450" height="254">
  <source media="(max-width: 767px)" srcset="image-mobile.jpg" type="image/jpg" width="450" height="254">

  <img src="image-fallback.jpg" alt="Description of your image" width="450" height="254">
</picture>
```

</FAQ>
<FAQ question="Will this help my SEO?">
Yes. Google explicitly states that page speed is a ranking factor. By reducing your image payload by up to 85% (using AVIF + correct sizing), your pages load faster, users stay longer, and search engines rank you higher.
