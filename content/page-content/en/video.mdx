## Stop Killing Your Page Speed with Heavy, Unoptimized Background Videos

Adding video to a website usually forces a trade-off: it looks great, but it destroys your load time. A standard 1080p video file can easily be 20MB+, which is a death sentence for mobile users on 4G networks.

### SlingSite solves the "Video Bloat" problem.

We don't just shrink your video; we create a complete HTML5 Streaming Suite. For every video you upload, we generate 18 specialized assets covering every device size, browser preference, and connection speed.

<FAQ question="The 'Triple-Codec' Strategy: Why One MP4 Isn't Enough?">
Browsers are fighting a war over video formats. Apple prefers HEVC, Google prefers VP9, and older devices only know AVC. If you only provide one format, you are either serving low-quality video or blocking users entirely.

We automatically transcode your video into the three critical formats required for a modern, bulletproof web experience:

- WebM (VP9 codec): The Google Standard. Highly compressed and crystal clear. Preferred by Chrome, Android, and Firefox. Usually 30-50% smaller than standard MP4
- MP4 (HEVC codec aka H.265): The Apple Standard. The only way to get high-efficiency video on iPhones, iPads, and Safari (macOS).
- MP4 (AVC codec aka H.264): The Universal Fallback. The "safety net" that works on virtually every device created in the last 15 years.

<FAQ question="Don't Forget the Poster: What is the Secret to Passing Core Web Vitals?">
A video file takes time to load. While it buffers, your user sees a blank space—or worse, a layout shift. This hurts your Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) and Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) scores.

To fix this, you need a lightweight "Poster Image" that loads instantly.

For every video size (Mobile, Tablet, Desktop), we extract the first frame and convert it into 3 optimized image formats: JPG, WebP, and AVIF.This ensures that even before the video starts playing, your site looks instant, professional, and visually stable.

### Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ question="Why do I need 6 files just for mobile?">
You need 3 video formats to ensure the browser can pick the one it supports natively (saving battery and data), and you need 3 image formats so the browser can load the lightest possible "preview" image immediately. It seems like a lot of files, but the user's browser will only download one video and one image.
</FAQ>
<FAQ question="How does this help with Apple devices?">
iPhones and Macs are optimized for HEVC (H.265). If you serve them a standard MP4, they have to work harder to decode it. If you serve them a VP9 WebM, they might not play it at all. By providing an HEVC version, you ensure Apple users get the highest quality with the least battery drain.

<FAQ question="How do I code this on my site?">
Implementing responsive video in React can be tricky because standard HTML `<video>` tags don't support media queries for sources like `<picture>` tags do.

We recommend using the open-source library @damiarita/react-responsive-video. It automatically handles the complex logic of swapping video sources and poster images based on the user's device, ensuring they only download exactly what they need.

Here is how easy it is to use with the assets SlingSite generates:

```JSX
import ReactResponsiveVideo from '@damiarita/react-responsive-video';

<ReactResponsiveVideo
  sizes={[
      {
        width: 1920,
        height: 1080,
        mediaQuery: '(min-width: 1200px)', // Desktop
        videoSources: [
          { url: 'desktop.webm', format: 'video/webm' }, // VP9
          { url: 'desktop-hevc.mp4', format: 'video/mp4' }, // HEVC
          { url: 'desktop.mp4', format: 'video/mp4' } // AVC
        ],
        posterSources: [
          { url: 'desktop-poster.avif', format: 'image/avif' },
          { url: 'desktop-poster.webp', format: 'image/webp' },
          { url: 'desktop-poster.jpg', format: 'image/jpeg' }
        ],
      },
      {
        width: 450,
        height: 800,
        mediaQuery: '(max-width: 768px)', // Mobile
        videoSources: [
          { url: 'mobile.webm', format: 'video/webm' },
          { url: 'mobile-hevc.mp4', format: 'video/mp4' },
          { url: 'mobile.mp4', format: 'video/mp4' }
        ],
        posterSources: [
          { url: 'mobile-poster.avif', format: 'image/avif' },
          { url: 'mobile-poster.webp', format: 'image/webp' },
          { url: 'mobile-poster.jpg', format: 'image/jpeg' }
        ],
      },
    ]}
/>
