## The site
SlingSite is a website designed to resize and compress you image and video assets before uploading them to you own website. You can upload as many files as you want and the site will generate 3 formats (jpg, webp and avif) for each type of device (mobile, tablet and desktop). You will be able to download the 9 resulting files (3 formats x 3 device sizes) to use them.

## Privacy and Security

slingsite is fully respectfull of your privacy. How do you know images are secure in our servers? Because we have no servers! Images never leave your browser. The resizing and compression happen in your computer. So, we will never see your files.

We do collect statistics of the site via GA4. But it is anonimous data as the original dimensions of the file, the saved MBytes...
